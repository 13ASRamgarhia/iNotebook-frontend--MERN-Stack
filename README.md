# iNotebook

### Getting Started

**App Link**: https://inotebook-cloud-notebook-app.netlify.app/

**iNotebook** is a React app which is developed using MERN Technologies. This is a cloud notebook app, which can be accessed by a device with internet connection. User needs to register in order start accessing the notes. Once user is registered, he/she can just login to his/her notebook and start writing. This app is using MongoDB to store the user data and their notes. User can add a new note and delete a note. For now, edit note functionality is not implemented in the app, that will be in future versions of the app.

**This is frontend for the iNotebook app. Please follow the following link for backend for the app - https://github.com/13ASRamgarhia/iNotebook-backend--MERN-Stack**

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default to view it in your browser. You can change port by making changes in the start script.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

`npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Technologies used

THE APP IS DEVELOPED USING MERN TECHNOLOGIES.

> `React` (Javascript framework) is used to design frontend for the app.

> `Tailwind` and `React bootstrap` is used for styling the components.

> This is a Single Page Application. App routing is implemented using `react-router-dom` package.

> To enhance the design, `Material UI` and `Semantic UI` are used.

> `universal-cookies` package is used for accessing cookies, which is used in login/logout functionality.

### Steps to run the app

Anyone can use the app by clicking on the link provided at the top of this documentary.
If one wants to run this app on his local machine for developement purpose, he can freely download the source code and start the development.

PRE-REQUISITE: VS Code, Node.js and proficiency in MERN Technologies

Note: If you recently installed Node.js, I would recommend you to restart your pc.

After downloading the app, open it in VS Code and type `npm install` in in-built cmd. This will install all necessary dependencies to run the app.
Once all dependecies are installed, run start command `npm start` to run app in development mode.
